## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
| # | Application | Stand‑out Feature #1 | Stand‑out Feature #2 |
|---|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **YouTube** | Recommender algorithm surfaces videos I actually want to watch | Engaging comment section that adds context and community |
| 2 | **Instagram** | Smart feed recommendation keeps content relevant | Active comment section for quick feedback & interaction |
| 3 | **WhatsApp** | Seamless group messaging (reliable, low‑friction) | Quick story uploads for ephemeral, low‑effort updates |

##  App Idea · **SportCast**
*SportCast* is a real‑time, multi‑sport live‑ticker that keeps fans in the loop without forcing them to juggle dozens of tabs or TV channels. The app pulls play‑by‑play data from trusted sports APIs, pushes instant alerts to your phone, and lets you jump straight to highlight clips the moment they drop.

### MVP feature set
1. **Customizable Live Feed**  
   Follow specific teams, leagues, or even individual players. The feed auto‑refreshes every few seconds and filters out sports you don’t care about.
2. **Granular Push Notifications**  
   Choose goal/score alerts, quarter‑time summaries, injury reports, or full post‑game recaps—silence everything else.
3. **Deep‑Link Highlights**  
   Tap any update to watch a 15‑second highlight clip or jump into a licensed live stream (where broadcast rights allow).
4. **Offline Catch‑Up**  
   Land in airplane mode? Open SportCast later and it collates a condensed timeline of everything you missed while you were away.
5. **Social Huddle** *(stretch goal)*  
   One‑tap reaction emojis and pop‑up group chats tied to the match you’re following—without the noise of general social media.
